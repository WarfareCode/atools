# Build Instructions

Qt development packages of Core, Widgets, XML and SQL are needed with minimum version 5.6.
GIT command line tools are needed for revision detection but are not required to build.

FSX/P3D Simconnect libraries for the Windows build are optional and only needed for FSX/P3D support.
The `atools.pro` file contains information how to enable the SimConnect build with the environment variable
`ATOOLS_SIMCONNECT_PATH`.

## Common

- Get and install Qt from http://www.qt.io or from the direct download https://download.qt.io/archive/qt .
  At least a version at or above 5.6 is needed. Linux users might use the Qt that comes with the distribution.
- Set a base directory for the builds in Qt Creator `Options` -> `Build & Run` if you'd like to use the GUI.
  For example `C:\Projects` or `$HOME/Projects`.
- Clone the atools GIT repository (`git clone https://github.com/albar965/atools.git`)

Look at the `atools.pro` file. There is a list of documented environment variables that can be set to customize the
build, like the inclusion of SimConnect or paths to the projects. Most of these variables are optional and use
a reasonable default value. Set these variables in the Qt Creator GUI or on the command line.

There is no need to edit the `*.pro` files.

## Default paths and Environment Variables

The projects can be built with almost no configuration changes since all project files fall back to sensible
default paths if the corresponding environment variables are not set. `APROJECTS` is the placeholder for the base directory.
Avoid paths with spaces if possible.

* `APROJECTS/atools`                           Sources.
* `APROJECTS/build-atools-debug`               Debug build.
* `APROJECTS/build-atools-release`             Release build.
* `C:\Program Files (x86)\...\SimConnect SDK`  SimConnect on Windows only. Optional. `ATOOLS_SIMCONNECT_PATH`

## Windows

- Import atools into the Qt Creator workspace.
- Configure the project and enable shadow build for release or debug versions.
- Clone atools from GIT to e.g.: `C:\Projects\atools`
- Use `../build-%{CurrentProject:Name}-%{CurrentBuild:Type}` for `Default build directory` in the
  Qt Creator options dialog. Otherwise adapt environment variables for depending builds.
- For atools use the default build directory of e.g.: `C:\Projects\build-atools-release`
- Set the build kit for atools MinGW 32bit.
- Run qmake from Qt Creator.
- Build.

The atools can be built using the MinGW environment only. MSVC will not work.

## Linux / macOS

Install Qt development packages. Version at least 5.6.

You can build the program on Linux or macOS similar to the Windows instructions above either using
the Qt Creator GUI or the command line.

SimConnect is not available on these platforms.

### To build the release version:

```
mkdir build-atools-release
cd build-atools-release
qmake ../atools/atools.pro CONFIG+=release
make
```

### To build the debug version:

```
mkdir build-atools-debug
cd build-atools-debug
qmake ../atools/atools.pro CONFIG+=debug
make
```
